## About
This repository contains the code developed during the Artificial Intelligence course @[cse.uoi.gr](http://cse.uoi.gr).

The first excercise is about the implementation of the [minimax algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax) 
and it's usage for deciding computer player moves during a custom game with a human player as an oponent.

The second excersise is about implementing the [A* (A star)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm) and
[UCS (Uniform Cost Search)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform-cost_search) algorithms and using them to
find the shortest path between an initial and two goal states. Note that the state space is randomly created every time.
